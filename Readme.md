# My little meteo <img src="resources/weather_img/wi-cloud.svg" width=50>

This is a little project for web dev courses at university.

## How to launch

This is a static website. Just go in source folder and open `index.html` with your favorite web browser.
It was tested on *Mozilla Firefox 81* and *Google Chrome 86*. For some unknown reason, icons on the chart are drawn
only with *Google Chrome* and doesn't appear on my version of *Firefox*.

## How to use

You can click on *Afficher la carte* to display the map. When you click, the meteo of the position is displayed (only work with France due to api used). 

You can enter a city name, and click on *Rechercher*. You can user code, like *33000* for *Bordeaux*. Sometimes, cities found with code doesn't exists according to the meteo api.
